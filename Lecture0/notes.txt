Notes

Unary - count on fingers
Base-1 - 1No. count
Base-2 or Binary digit - a bit 0 or 1
Base 10 - decimal 1-9

Bit - is a zero or 1 

A bit could be assumed light a light bulb where 0 is off & 1 is on

Transistors that are on for 1 or off for 0

Base-2 a.k.a Binary

base-2 is to the power 0, 1, 2 etc and rises the terms 4 bit, 8 bit, 16 bit etc

byte - is 8No. bits in a byte 

This could be a possible combination of 256

0^1, 0^2, 0^4, 0^8, 0^16, 0^32, 0^64, 0^128

A = 65 can be represented by 8 bits 01000001

so B= 66 can be represented by 8 bits 01000010

ASCII - American Security Code for InterChange

We could therfore use this with designated lettering to an 8 bit sequence decifer a message being sent from for instance a message. 

01001000 = 72 = H
01001001 = 73 = I
00100001 = 33 = !

We can map numbers to numbers fo instance 49 = 1 using ASCII

Unicode is mapping of letters to numbers in many different lanuauges

Emoji are fonts that can be rendered with a certain string of bytes
