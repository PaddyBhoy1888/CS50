Notes

Unary - count on fingers
Base-1 - 1No. count
Base-2 or Binary digit - a bit 0 or 1
Base 10 - decimal 1-9

Bit - is a zero or 1 

A bit could be assumed light a light bulb where 0 is off & 1 is on

Transistors that are on for 1 or off for 0

Base-2 a.k.a Binary

base-2 is to the power 0, 1, 2 etc and rises the terms 4 bit, 8 bit, 16 bit etc

byte - is 8No. bits in a byte 

This could be a possible combination of 256

0^1, 0^2, 0^4, 0^8, 0^16, 0^32, 0^64, 0^128

A = 65 can be represented by 8 bits 01000001

so B= 66 can be represented by 8 bits 01000010

ASCII - American Security Code for InterChange

We could therfore use this with designated lettering to an 8 bit sequence decifer a message being sent from for instance a message. 

01001000 = 72 = H
01001001 = 73 = I
00100001 = 33 = !

We can map numbers to numbers fo instance 49 = 1 using ASCII

Unicode is mapping of letters to numbers in many different lanuauges

Emoji are fonts that can be rendered with a certain string of bytes

RGB - a number can be used to represent how much RED/GREEN/BLUE is displayed
images are created by a pattern of bits with colours represent

Videos are a sequence of images over time and can be represented by RGB e.g. 24 frames a second.

Music can be digitised by assigning some representation by bits

Abstraction refers to the simplication of something so you can focus on the high level goals rather than the finner details.

Generally an abstration will be an algorithm in the computer science.

Pseudocode - English like sintacts. Write out the problem and what steps would be needed to do to solve a problem e.g.
- Find a name in a phone book: - 
1 - Pick up the phone book
2 - open to the middle of the phone book
3 - look at the page.
4 - if the person is on the page
5 -     call the person
6 - else if person is earlier in the book 
7 -     open to middle of left half of the book
8 -     go back to step 3
9 - else if person is later in the book 
10 -    open to the middle of the right half of the book
11 -    go back to step 3
12 - else 
13 -    Quit

We can notice that the verbs in the solution act as opertation of doing something. Similiarly in programming we refer these verbs or actions as fuctions. Function are when we are asking the computer to do something.

The if, else, else if are what is refered to as conditional e.g. fork in a road where there are options to go one way or another. 

The question part of the problem where we ask in step 4, 6, 9 can be defined as boolien expresions where the question is define with a yes or no or in computing cases True or False (1 or 0).

The indentation is important as it implies the result of the booling would determine the next step as example if step 4 was True then step 5 would be next were as if False then it would jump to step 6.

The lines 8 & 11 act as a loop cycle as the problem reduces it will eventuall get to line 13 and will stop/quit.



Scratch

Open Scratch programme from "scratch.mit.edu"

Here we can play around with the visual and written formats of programming.

Using the events tab we can input a block that is defined as "When 'flag' clicked"
Then adding a block from the looks tab we can add "say [insert]"

Clicking the flag in the top right will run this programme. This is what is called triggering the event.
