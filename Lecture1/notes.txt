Source code > compiler > machine code

We write in sorce code, the complier converts the source into machine code ( 0 & 1's) that the machine can read

We want code to write that will be correct, i.e. code correctness

Design is subjective, the better design your code is written can run faster and easier to understand.

The style of your code can be helpful for humans to read & understand.
