Source code > compiler > machine code

We write in sorce code, the complier converts the source into machine code ( 0 & 1's) that the machine can read

We want code to write that will be correct, i.e. code correctness

Design is subjective, the better design your code is written can run faster and easier to understand.

The style of your code can be helpful for humans to read & understand.

Syntax highlighting is part of text editors tha will highlight specific components of the syntax to help identify parts.

$ make hello - This command will compile the code to binary
$ ./hello - This will run the programe 

Escape sequence are when we add a line so the prompt symbol is clearly defined on new line e.g. "\n" for the new line

#include <stdio.h> - This is a header file that declairs a file exists i.e. "printf". This is a type of library that informs the compiler that we wish to use this as part of our function.

Data types - Strings, integers, char, bool etc. 

#Conditionals#

$ code <insert file name>.c #is a short cut way to make a file in C language.

In C language we need to define what the variable is i.e if it is a int, string, bool etc e.g. 'int x'

The command 'Ctrl+K+C' is used to comment out code.
The command 'Ctrl+K+U' is used to comment in code.

Make sure to add libraries at the start of each new code file. 

int main(void) has not been discussed but will always be at the start of the code at the moment. 

When dealing with single characters using char then 'single' quoyes should be used

When creating a character code we can use upper and lower case, instead or repeating lines after lines of the same code we can use and or type statement and in c '||' the two vertical bars can be used to represent the 'OR'

#VARIABLES#

Only when you create a variable do you need to define it i.e. string, char, bool etc, when we add to a variable we do not need to do this. 

There are different ways we can write adding to a variable or subtracting e.g. 'counter++'
