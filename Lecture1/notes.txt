Source code > compiler > machine code

We write in sorce code, the complier converts the source into machine code ( 0 & 1's) that the machine can read

We want code to write that will be correct, i.e. code correctness

Design is subjective, the better design your code is written can run faster and easier to understand.

The style of your code can be helpful for humans to read & understand.

Syntax highlighting is part of text editors tha will highlight specific components of the syntax to help identify parts.

$ make hello - This command will compile the code to binary
$ ./hello - This will run the programe 

Escape sequence are when we add a line so the prompt symbol is clearly defined on new line e.g. "\n" for the new line

#include <stdio.h> - This is a header file that declairs a file exists i.e. "printf". This is a type of library that informs the compiler that we wish to use this as part of our function.

Data types - Strings, integers, char, bool etc. 

#Conditionals#

$ code <insert file name>.c #is a short cut way to make a file in C language.

In C language we need to define what the variable is i.e if it is a int, string, bool etc e.g. 'int x'

The command 'Ctrl+K+C' is used to comment out code.
The command 'Ctrl+K+U' is used to comment in code.

Make sure to add libraries at the start of each new code file. 

int main(void) has not been discussed but will always be at the start of the code at the moment. 

When dealing with single characters using char then 'single' quoyes should be used

When creating a character code we can use upper and lower case, instead or repeating lines after lines of the same code we can use and or type statement and in c '||' the two vertical bars can be used to represent the 'OR'

#VARIABLES#

Only when you create a variable do you need to define it i.e. string, char, bool etc, when we add to a variable we do not need to do this. 

There are different ways we can write adding to a variable or subtracting e.g. 'counter++' Adds 1 'counter--;' subtracts 1

LOOPS

There are a few ways to create loops that count up or down. 

E.G.
int i = 1;
while (i <= 3)
{
    printf("Meow\n");
    i++;
}

settin 1 = 1 & then while loop to stop when the i counter is greater than or equal to 3

For loops is an alternative to a loop but does the same thing effectively 

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        printf("Meow\n");
    }

The first part is executed once (int = 0) sets the bar effectively as a point to start from, the for loop then cycles through the second and third. i.e. is ) less than 3? YES? increment 1 & printf statement, is 1 now less than 3? YES? increment 1 & printf statement, is 2 now less than 3?YES? increment 1 & printf statement. is 3 now less than 3? NO. loops STOPS 

Forever block i.e. do the follow forever. 
A programme loops forever could be checking for inputs or checking time or etc

E.G.
int main(void)
    {
        while(true)
        {
            printf("Meow\n")
        }
    }

Where we state that a boolen is true. The trus is a statement that needs to be included in a package.
The computer defaults to a true and as such would always be true a loop forever.

OPERATING SYSTEMS or UI's 

Alternative to window or Mac OS, both have terminals but Linux is more favourable for server based tasks

PROBLEM sets

Mario.c 

The problem starts with how could we could something that would resemble the typical 4x? you would see in the old 2D game. 

An example could be: - 
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("????\n");
}

This would code to show the ???? but is very basic. 

We can make this more concise with a for loop.
